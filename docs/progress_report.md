# Auto-Suture-Pad-Analysis Project Progress Report

## Project Overview
The Auto-Suture-Pad-Analysis project is a computer vision-based system for analyzing surgical sutures using YOLOv8 and OpenCV. The project consists of three main components:
1. Machine Learning (ML) component for suture detection and analysis
2. API layer for serving the ML models
3. Frontend interface for user interaction

## Current Progress

### Infrastructure
- ✅ Docker setup completed with separate containers for ML and API services
- ✅ Environment configuration established
- ✅ Basic project structure implemented
- ✅ Health check endpoints implemented

### Machine Learning Component
- ✅ YOLOv8 integration for object detection
- ✅ Multiple preprocessing options implemented:
  - Grayscale conversion
  - Edge detection
  - Contour detection
- ✅ Model weights management system in place
- ✅ ML service containerization completed

### API Layer
- ✅ FastAPI-based REST API implementation
- ✅ Basic endpoints implemented:
  - Health check
  - Image analysis
- ✅ Structured logging system in place
- ✅ API containerization completed

### Frontend
- ✅ Basic frontend structure established
- ✅ Integration with API endpoints

## Next Steps
1. Enhance ML model performance and accuracy
2. Implement additional preprocessing techniques
3. Expand API functionality with more endpoints
4. Improve frontend user interface
5. Add comprehensive testing suite
6. Implement CI/CD pipeline

## Current Challenges
- Need to optimize model inference speed
- Integration between ML and API components needs refinement
- Frontend development needs more attention
