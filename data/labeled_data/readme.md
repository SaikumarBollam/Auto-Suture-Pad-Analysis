# labeled_data Folder Overview

The `labeled_data` folder contains datasets with labeled images for training, validation, and testing machine learning models. These labels are essential for supervised learning tasks, where the model is trained to predict specific classes or properties of sutures.

## Structure and Purpose

### 1. **train/**
This folder contains the labeled dataset for training the model. The images and their associated labels are used to teach the model how to identify and assess suture quality.

### 2. **val/**
Holds the labeled validation dataset. These images and labels are used during training to evaluate the model's performance and prevent overfitting.

### 3. **test/**
Contains the labeled dataset for testing the model after training. This dataset assesses the model's generalization ability on unseen data.

### 4. **.gitkeep**
A placeholder file to ensure the folder structure is tracked in version control systems like Git.

### 5. **README.dataset.txt**
Describes details about the dataset used in this folder, including its sources, structure, and preparation process.

### 6. **README.roboflow.txt**
Provides information on how the dataset was processed or generated using Roboflow.

### 7. **data.yaml**
A configuration file that specifies:
- Dataset paths.
- Classes included in the labeled dataset.
- Training, validation, and testing splits.

## Purpose of Labeled Data
The labeled data is critical for supervised machine learning tasks in this project. By providing annotated examples, the model learns to identify features and patterns that define suture quality, enabling automated assessment.

## Usage
1. **Training**: Use the `train/` folder along with `data.yaml` to initiate the training process.
2. **Validation**: Use the `val/` folder for evaluating model performance during training.
3. **Testing**: Use the `test/` folder to measure the final performance of the trained model.
