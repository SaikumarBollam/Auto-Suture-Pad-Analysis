# data_obb Folder Overview

The `data_obb` folder contains data, models, and configurations specifically for training and evaluating oriented bounding box (OBB) models in the ML-based suture pad analysis project. This setup supports precise detection and analysis of suture quality using YOLO-based OBB models.

## Structure and Purpose of Subdirectories and Files

### 1. **runs/detect/predict/**
Stores predictions and results generated by the OBB model during the detection phase.

### 2. **suture_obbyolo/best_model/**
Contains the best-performing model files from the training process. These files can be used for evaluation or inference on new datasets.

### 3. **train/**
Holds training dataset files, including images and annotations, prepared for model training.

### 4. **valid/**
Contains validation dataset files for evaluating the performance of the model during training.

### 5. **README.dataset.txt**
A text file providing details about the dataset used for OBB training and evaluation.

### 6. **README.roboflow.txt**
Describes how the dataset was generated or processed using Roboflow, a common tool for dataset preparation.

### 7. **Suture Analysis.v8.yolov8-obb.zip**
A compressed archive containing the dataset or additional configurations for YOLOv8 OBB analysis.

### 8. **data.yaml**
Configuration file specifying the dataset structure, paths, class names, and other details required by the YOLOv8 model.

### 9. **yolov8n.pt**
The YOLOv8 model weights file (nano version). This file contains pretrained weights used for initializing and fine-tuning the model.

## Key Features
- **Training and Validation Support**: The `train` and `valid` directories contain organized datasets for model training and validation.
- **Best Model Storage**: The `suture_obbyolo/best_model/` directory provides quick access to the top-performing model for further testing or deployment.
- **Predictions**: Outputs from model inference are stored in the `runs/detect/predict/` directory for easy review.

## Usage
- **Training**: Use `data.yaml` and the `train/` directory to initiate model training.
- **Validation**: Evaluate the model using the `valid/` directory.
- **Inference**: Load `yolov8n.pt` to perform inference on new data, with outputs stored in `runs/detect/predict/`.
