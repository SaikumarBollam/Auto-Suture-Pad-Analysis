# new_ignore Folder Overview

The `new_ignore` folder contains the primary dataset and configuration files used for the ML-based suture pad analysis project. This dataset is the final, refined media, carefully prepared and labeled for optimal model training, validation, and evaluation.

## Structure and Purpose

### 1. **train/**
This folder contains the primary training dataset, including images and annotations. These files are used to train the machine learning models to recognize and assess suture quality effectively.

### 2. **valid/**
Holds the validation dataset, which is used during the training process to monitor model performance and prevent overfitting.

### 3. **README.dataset.txt**
A text file providing detailed information about the dataset, including its source, structure, and preparation process.

### 4. **README.roboflow.txt**
Describes how the dataset was processed or augmented using Roboflow, a tool for dataset preparation.

### 5. **Suture Analysis.v17i.yolov8-obb.zip**
A compressed archive of the dataset and configurations used in this project. It includes all resources necessary for oriented bounding box (OBB) analysis with YOLOv8.

### 6. **data.yaml**
The configuration file specifying:
- Dataset paths for training and validation.
- Classes included in the dataset.
- Parameters required for YOLOv8 model training.

### 7. **output_annotated_image.jpg**
A sample annotated image that demonstrates the results of the model on the dataset. This serves as a visual example of how the model interprets the data.

## Purpose of This Folder
The `new_ignore` folder is the final and most important dataset directory for this project. It has been optimized to:
- Provide high-quality training and validation datasets.
- Ensure compatibility with YOLOv8 for oriented bounding box detection.
- Include clear annotations and configurations for seamless training and evaluation.

## Usage
1. **Training**: Use the `train/` folder with `data.yaml` to initiate model training.
2. **Validation**: Use the `valid/` folder to evaluate model performance during training.
3. **Model Outputs**: Reference `output_annotated_image.jpg` to understand the model's capabilities and outputs.
