# preprocessed_images_all Folder Overview

The `preprocessed_images_all` folder contains images that have undergone basic preprocessing to ensure consistency and compatibility with the machine learning models used in the suture pad analysis project.

## Structure and Purpose

### 1. **train/images/**
Contains preprocessed images used for training the machine learning models. These images are formatted to maintain uniform input during the training phase.

### 2. **valid/images/**
Holds preprocessed images designated for validation. These images are used to evaluate model performance during training.

### 3. **test/images/**
Includes preprocessed images for testing the final trained model. These images help assess the model's generalization on unseen data.

## Purpose
The preprocessed images in this folder serve as an intermediary dataset, ensuring that input data is clean, normalized, and ready for further processing or model training.

## Usage
- **Training**: Use `train/images/` to train the model.
- **Validation**: Use `valid/images/` to evaluate the model during training.
- **Testing**: Use `test/images/` to test the trained model.

This folder is not critical but provides a useful reference point for normalized datasets in the project.
