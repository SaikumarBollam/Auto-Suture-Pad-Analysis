# Notebooks Folder Overview

The `notebooks` folder is designed to house Jupyter Notebooks for the ML-based suture pad analysis project. These notebooks are intended for exploratory data analysis, model training, and results visualization.

## Purpose of the Notebooks Folder

1. Serve as a central repository for organizing Jupyter Notebooks related to the project.
2. Facilitate data analysis, model development, and results interpretation in a structured and reproducible manner.

### Note:
- **.gitkeep**: A placeholder file included to ensure the folder is tracked in Git even when empty.

## Usage
