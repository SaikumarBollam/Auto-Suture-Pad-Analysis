# suture_obbyolo Folder Overview

The `suture_obbyolo` folder contains subfolders and resources related to YOLO-based object detection tasks. This folder organizes model artifacts and configurations critical to training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Structure and Purpose of Subfolders

### 1. **best_model/**
This subfolder contains configuration files for the best-performing YOLO model. It includes files like `args.yaml` that store training parameters and settings.

### 2. **best_model2/**
This subfolder likely contains another version or iteration of the best-performing YOLO model, with additional artifacts or configurations.

## Purpose of the `suture_obbyolo` Folder

1. Organize and centralize YOLO model-related resources and configurations.
2. Provide clear access to different iterations of best-trained models for evaluation or deployment.

## Usage

1. Navigate to `best_model/` or `best_model2/` to access specific model artifacts.
2. Use the resources in these subfolders for deploying or analyzing the YOLO models.
