A YAML configuration file storing training parameters, dataset paths, hyperparameters, and model settings. This file is used to document the settings applied during this iteration of training.

## Purpose of the `best_model2` Folder

1. Provide an alternative or updated configuration for the YOLO model.
2. Enable evaluation of different versions or iterations of the trained model.

## Usage

1. Refer to `args.yaml` for training parameters and settings (if available).
2. Compare this iteration with the `best_model` version to analyze improvements or changes.
