# enhanced_images_all Folder Overview

The `enhanced_images_all` folder serves as the output directory for storing enhanced images generated during the ML-based suture pad analysis project. These enhanced images are processed versions of the input data, optimized for improved feature detection and model performance.

## Structure and Purpose

### 1. **train/images/**
Contains enhanced images used for training the machine learning models. These images are preprocessed to improve the model's ability to learn features.

### 2. **valid/images/**
Holds enhanced images designated for validation. These images are used to evaluate the model during training to prevent overfitting and monitor performance.

### 3. **test/images/**
Includes enhanced images for testing the final trained model. These images help assess the model's performance on unseen data.

## Purpose of Enhanced Images
Enhanced images are created by applying various preprocessing techniques to improve:
- Contrast and brightness.
- Noise reduction.
- Clarity of key features in the images.

These enhancements ensure the model performs better during training, validation, and testing by focusing on critical details.

## Usage
- **Training**: Use `train/images/` to train the model.
- **Validation**: Use `valid/images/` to evaluate the model during training.
- **Testing**: Use `test/images/` to test the final model on unseen data.
