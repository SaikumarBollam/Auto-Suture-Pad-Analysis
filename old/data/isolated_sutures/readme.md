# isolated_sutures Folder Overview

The `isolated_sutures` folder contains images of sutures extracted and isolated from raw datasets. These images focus specifically on suture regions, making them ideal for detailed analysis and model training for suture quality assessment.

## Structure and Purpose

### 1. **train/images/**
Contains isolated suture images used for training the machine learning models. These images ensure the model learns to focus on suture-specific features.

### 2. **valid/images/**
Holds isolated suture images designated for validation during the training process. These images are used to monitor the model's performance and prevent overfitting.

### 3. **test/images/**
Includes isolated suture images for testing the final trained model. These images evaluate the model's generalization capabilities on unseen data.

## Purpose of Isolated Suture Images
By isolating suture regions, this folder provides a clean and focused dataset for:
- Improving the precision of suture quality predictions.
- Reducing noise and distractions from the surrounding context in raw images.

## Usage
- **Training**: Use `train/images/` to train the model.
- **Validation**: Use `valid/images/` to evaluate the model during the training phase.
- **Testing**: Use `test/images/` to test the final trained model on unseen data.
