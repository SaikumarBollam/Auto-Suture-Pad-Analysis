# labeled_data_all Folder Overview

The `labeled_data_all` folder serves as a comprehensive repository of labeled datasets used for training, validation, and testing machine learning models in the ML-based suture pad analysis project. This folder consolidates all labeled data into a single directory for streamlined management and usage.

## Structure and Purpose

### 1. **train/**
Contains the training dataset, including images and their associated labels. This dataset is used to teach the model to identify and assess suture quality.

### 2. **valid/**
Holds the validation dataset. This data is used during training to evaluate the model's performance and ensure it generalizes well.

### 3. **test/images/**
Includes the testing dataset, which is used to assess the final trained model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

### 4. **README.dataset.txt**
Provides detailed information about the dataset, including its source, structure, and preprocessing steps.

### 5. **README.roboflow.txt**
Describes how the dataset was generated or augmented using Roboflow, a common tool for dataset preparation.

### 6. **Suture Analysis.v6i.yolov8-obb.zip**
A compressed file containing the dataset or additional configurations for training oriented bounding box (OBB) models.

### 7. **data.yaml**
A configuration file specifying:
- Paths to the datasets (training, validation, testing).
- Classes included in the dataset.
- Dataset-specific details required for YOLOv8 training and testing.

## Purpose of Consolidated Labeled Data
The `labeled_data_all` folder simplifies the management of labeled datasets by combining all relevant data into one directory. It supports:
- **Efficient Training**: Provides a ready-to-use structure for training models.
- **Validation**: Ensures easy access to validation data for performance monitoring.
- **Testing**: Enables consistent evaluation of the model using test data.

## Usage
1. **Training**: Use the `train/` folder along with `data.yaml` to initiate the training process.
2. **Validation**: Use the `valid/` folder for evaluating model performance during training.
3. **Testing**: Use the `test/images/` folder to measure the final performance of the trained model.
