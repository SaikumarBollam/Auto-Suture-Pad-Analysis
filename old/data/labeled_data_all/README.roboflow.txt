The dataset includes 47 images.
Suture-Type are annotated in YOLOv8 Oriented Object Detection format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, counter-clockwise
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1.01 percent of pixels
