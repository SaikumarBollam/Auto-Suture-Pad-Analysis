# suture_obbyolo Folder Overview

The `suture_obbyolo` folder, located inside the `scripts` folder, contains specialized scripts and resources related to YOLO-based object detection tasks. This folder includes a `best_model` subfolder, which holds the best-performing trained YOLO model artifacts.

## Structure and Purpose

### 1. **best_model/**
This subfolder contains the best-performing YOLO model, saved during training. It typically includes model weights (`best.pt`) and other relevant artifacts needed for deployment or further analysis.

## Purpose of the `suture_obbyolo` Folder

1. Organize and centralize YOLO model artifacts and related resources.
2. Provide access to the best-trained YOLO model for deployment or evaluation.

## Usage

1. Use the model files in `best_model/` for deploying the YOLO model.
2. Utilize the artifacts for inference or further fine-tuning.
