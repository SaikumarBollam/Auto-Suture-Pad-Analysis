# best_model Folder Overview

The `best_model` folder contains configuration files related to the best-performing YOLO model. These configurations are critical for reproducing the training setup and fine-tuning the model.

## Structure and Purpose of Files

### 1. **args.yaml**
A YAML configuration file that stores the training parameters, including dataset paths, hyperparameters, and model settings. This file ensures reproducibility by documenting the settings used during training.

## Purpose of the `best_model` Folder

1. Provide configuration details for the best-performing YOLO model.
2. Serve as a reference for replicating or fine-tuning the model setup.

## Usage

1. Refer to `args.yaml` for training parameters and settings.
2. Use these configurations to reproduce the model or adapt them for further experiments.
