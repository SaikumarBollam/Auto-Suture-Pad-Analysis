# Detect Folder Overview

The `detect` folder stores outputs generated during object detection tasks using the trained detection model.

## Structure and Purpose

### 1. **train/**
Contains outputs, logs, and visualizations from the training process. Refer to the `train` folder for details.

### 2. **val/**
Contains outputs and metrics generated during the validation process. Refer to the `val` folder for details.

## Purpose

The `detect` folder organizes the results of detection experiments for both training and validation, enabling comparisons and detailed analysis of model performance.

## Usage
1. Review outputs in the `train/` folder to analyze training progress.
2. Use metrics and visualizations in the `val/` folder to evaluate the detection model's validation performance.
