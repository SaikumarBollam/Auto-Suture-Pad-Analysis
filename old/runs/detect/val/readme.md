# Val Folder Overview

The `val` folder stores outputs generated during the validation process of the detection model.

## Structure and Purpose

### 1. **F1_curve.png**
Visualization of the F1-score curve across validation runs.

### 2. **PR_curve.png and P_curve.png**
Precision-Recall and Precision curves for model evaluation.

### 3. **R_curve.png**
Recall curve, showing how recall changes during validation.

### 4. **val_batch0_labels.jpg**
Ground truth labels for the validation batch.

### 5. **val_batch0_pred.jpg**
Predictions generated by the model for the validation batch.

### 6. **events.out.tfevents.* (TensorBoard Log File)**
A log file generated during validation, compatible with TensorBoard. This file contains detailed metrics such as validation loss and performance indicators tracked during validation. It is used for visualizing trends and metrics.

## Purpose

The `val` folder tracks model performance on validation data, helping in hyperparameter tuning and overfitting prevention.

## Usage
1. Use visual outputs (`F1_curve.png`, `PR_curve.png`, etc.) to evaluate validation performance.
2. Compare ground truth (`val_batch0_labels.jpg`) with predictions (`val_batch0_pred.jpg`).
3. Use `events.out.tfevents.*` with TensorBoard to analyze validation metrics in detail.
