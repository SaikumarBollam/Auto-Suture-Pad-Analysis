# Results Folder Overview

The `results` folder serves as the main directory for storing outputs generated during the ML-based suture pad analysis project. It includes subfolders for organizing evaluation metrics, visual outputs, and other relevant results.

## Structure and Purpose of Subdirectories

### 1. **images/**
Stores visual outputs, such as plots, graphs, and model predictions. These are used for visualizing and interpreting model performance.

### 2. **metrics/**
Contains performance metrics and logs from training and validation. These data points are critical for analyzing the effectiveness of the models.

### 3. **.gitkeep**
A placeholder file included to ensure the folder and its subdirectories are tracked in Git, even if they are empty.

## General Purpose of the `results` Folder
This folder acts as a centralized repository for all outputs related to model performance and evaluation. It ensures easy access and structured storage for results, enabling better analysis and reporting.

## Usage
- **Visual Outputs**: Use `images/` to store and review graphical representations of results.
- **Performance Metrics**: Save logs and evaluation data in `metrics/` for performance tracking.
