# Images Folder Overview

The `images` folder is intended to store visual outputs generated from the ML-based suture pad analysis project. These outputs include visualizations of model predictions and performance metrics.

## Purpose of Visual Outputs

1. Evaluate model predictions visually, such as segmentation results or classification overlays.
2. Provide visual insights into training dynamics through plots (e.g., accuracy/loss trends).
3. Support effective communication of results through clear and organized images.

## Usage

- Save outputs such as segmentation results, accuracy/loss plots, and confusion matrices.
- Maintain a clear naming convention for files.
- Organize images by purpose or experiment as needed.
